# ðŸ§® Data Analysis Using SQL

This project contains SQL queries used to analyze sales and transaction data from a retail database. The queries cover customer data, transaction filtering, revenue calculation, and data joins. Below are the queries and their purposes.

# Data Analysis Using SQL

1. Show all customer records  
`SELECT * FROM customers;`

2. Show total number of customers  
`SELECT count(*) FROM customers;`

3. Show transactions for Chennai market (market code for chennai is Mark001)  
`SELECT * FROM transactions where market_code='Mark001';`

4. Show distinct product codes that were sold in chennai  
`SELECT distinct product_code FROM transactions where market_code='Mark001';`

5. Show transactions where currency is US dollars  
`SELECT * from transactions where currency="USD";`

6. Show transactions in 2020 join by date table  
`SELECT transactions.*, date.* FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020;`

7. Show total revenue in year 2020  
`SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020 and transactions.currency="INR" or transactions.currency="USD";`

8. Show total revenue in year 2020, January Month  
`SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020 and date.month_name="January" and (transactions.currency="INR" or transactions.currency="USD");`

9. Show total revenue in year 2020 in Chennai  
`SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020 and transactions.market_code='Mark001';`


# Data Analysis Using Power BI

1. Formula to create norm_amount column  
```powerquery
= Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Rows", "norm_amount", each if [currency] = "USD" or [currency] ="USD#(cr)" then [sales_amount]*75 else [sales_amount], type any)
